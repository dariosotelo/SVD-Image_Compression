	abstract="The synchronization of stable oscillations is a well-known non-linear phenomenon frequently found in nature and widely used in technology [1--5]. Under synchronization, one usually understands the ability of coupled oscillators to switch from an independent oscillation regime, characterized by beats, to a stable coupled oscillation regime with identical or rational frequencies, when the coupling constant increases.",
